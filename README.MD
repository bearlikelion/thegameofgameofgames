## About the game

This is my first game entry ever, as well as my first *released* Unity project! This was a solo development effort that I throughly enjoyed. The game itself is inspired by [Ellen's Game of Games](https://www.nbc.com/ellens-game-of-games). It has the player answer word games and trivia questions until they reach three strikes [X] or run out of questions.

## Development
* [Unity 2017 LTS](https://unity3d.com/)
* Audio from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
* Animations using DOTween(http://dotween.demigiant.com/)
