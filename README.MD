## About the game

This is my first game entry ever, as well as my first *released* Unity project! This was a solo development effort that I throughly enjoyed. The game itself is inspired by [Ellen's Game of Games](https://www.nbc.com/ellens-game-of-games) from NBCUniversal. It challenges the player answer word games, riddles, and trivia questions within ten seconds. Incorrect answers give the player a strike **X**, three strikes you're out. There is also a win condition if the player manages to answer all programmed questions without reaching the three strike limit.

## Development

* [Unity 2017 LTS](https://unity3d.com/)
